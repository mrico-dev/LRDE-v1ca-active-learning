The repository contains most of the work done at LRDE on the subject of "Active Learing on Visibly One-Counter Systems".

The goal of the program is to build a Visibly One-Counter Automaton from a teacher who has knowledge over a language. The explanation of the algorithm can be found in the *Report.pdf* file

The *angluin_regular/* directory contains a python version of Angluin's algorithm working on regular languages.
The *one_counter/* directory contains two sub-directories: the *python/* and *cpp/* directories. They contain a Python and C++ implementation of the algorithm.

Note that the python programs were made as quickly coded prototypes. The C++ program on the other hand was made to be more optimized and clean.

The C++ version of the program is currently being worked on in order to support one-counter automata, and to be more clear to read and optimized.
The Python codes are left as draft of the C++ program.
