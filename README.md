# 01/21 to 08/21 work at LRDE

--

The repository contains most of the work done at LRDE on the subject of "Active Learing on Visibly One-Counter Systems".
You can find the report of my research work, and 3 directories containing code related to the project, as explained in the report.

The *angluin_regular/* directory contains a python version of Angluin's algorithm working on regular languages.
The *one_counter/* directory contains two sub-directories: the *python/* and *cpp/* directories. They contain a Python and C++ implementation of the algorithm described in the report.

Note that the python programs were made as quickly coded prototypes. The C++ program on the other hand was made to be more optimized and clean.
